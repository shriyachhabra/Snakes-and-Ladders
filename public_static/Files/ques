You are  a police inspector who is deployed in a case for investigating a terrorist attack,while the investigation you encountered 2 identical bombs on a 100th floor ,it may blast if dropped from the first floor or may not even blast if dropped from 100th floor.
But now for testing the bombs on the same place ,lab chemists need to figure out the highest floor of a 100-storey building a bomb can be dropped without breaking. Now the question is how many drops the chemist need to make if they're  allowed to blast 2 bombs in the process.

i = 0;
j = n-1;
do
{
k = (i+j)/2;
if (x <= listA[k])

A networking company uses a compression technique to encode the message before transmitting over the network. Suppose the message contains the following characters with their frequency:
character   Frequency
    a           5
    b           9
    c           12
    d           13
    e           16
    f           45
Run on IDE
Note : Each character in input message takes 1 byte.
If the compression technique used is Huffman Coding, how many bits will be saved in the message?
A) 224
B) 800
C) 576
D) 324
