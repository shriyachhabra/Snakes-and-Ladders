        1)In this battle against snakes,players are advised to use their mind swords with proper technique
        to solve the questions they encounter at each level  XD<br>
        2)There are 16 such levels. Each level will either have a coding or<br> a non- coding question.
        Every 4th level will have a coding question.The pain of the players will grow as they cross a level XD<br>
        ( Difficulty level of questions will increase :P )<br>
        3)Non- coding questions will test the players' knowledge of Data structures and algorithms .<br>
        4)For every correct answer to a non-coding question your score will increase by 2 points along with increment
        in level and for every incorrect answer your score will be reduced by 1 point but the level will remain the same.<br>
        5)For coding questions, the score will be increased according to the number of test cases passed.
        You can skip the coding question if you want but your score will be decreased by 2 points.<br>
        6)Team with the maximum score wins the battle.<br>
        (YES,Even if you reach a higher level but score is less as compared <br>to other players you wont win the battle XD ).<br>
